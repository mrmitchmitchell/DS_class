I attended a meetup in Austin, TX designed for people interested in becoming a data scientist. The meetup had a panel of individuals who work in the field, locally, and they talked about their experiences as well as what they look for in employees. Overall, it was a positive experience. 
The pros were that I made some contacts in the field. Most of the other people attending were newly interested in the data science field, like me, which gave us all something to talk about. The panel was very friendly, open to answering any quesitons, and knowledgeable. One panelist came from academia (a former professor) but the rest of the panel were from a math oriented background and fell into data science. Their stories were interesting to listen to.
The cons were that I did not meet anyone who came from a CS background and worked their way into data science. One panelist went so far as to say that CS people are less often to move into this field than math educated people are to move into CS. Also, all of the panelists come from the tech sector, so every project they described centered around company profits or consumer acquisition. I hope to be the exception to the norm for a CS person moving into data science, but I also want my work to mean something to me. I would hope that the data science position I eventually fill will task me to solve real world problems, and enhance people's lives, rather than find ways to retain customers and increase profits.
