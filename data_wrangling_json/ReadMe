JSON Exercises

1. Find the 10 countries with most projects
2. Find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode')
3. In 2. above you will notice that some entries have only the code and the name is missing. Create a dataframe with the missing names filled in.

For exercise 1, we have one row per project, per country, 
so a simple count of the appearance of the country name will provide the number of projects

For the second exercise, we lod the json and then noralize it on the desired field.
sorting by the value counts of the codes returned gives us the top theme codes

To fill in missing data, I take this dataset and create a lookup:
First, remove all rows ith blanks.
Second, remove duplicates.

We ae left with a smal dataset that has a code and a theme name.
Go back to the original dataset and map the name values to the codes, filling in all missing values
